**Updated:** 2026-07-17

**Phase:** 8.1 + 8.2 complete; 8.3/8.3.1 Scout QA runtime; 8.4 discovery + triage (v1.1.0); Final Phase I complete pre-send pipeline (Prospect QA Radar v1.9.0) implemented. Remaining roadmap frozen at Final Phase II + Final Independent Acceptance.

This file is the registry of all documentation tracked by the workbench.
Run `python tools/docs_audit.py` to verify that these docs are current.

## Foundation-only features — not yet runtime

These features have schema foundations in `core/schemas/` but no runtime implementation yet.
Any doc describing them must include a qualifier: `schema-only`, `foundation-only`, `planned`, or `[planned]`.

| Feature | Schema module | Runtime phase | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Credential use + auth execution (foundation-only) | `credentials.py`, `auth_flow.py` | Phase 2+ | Schema defaults block all credential use; no runtime auth execution yet |
| Mobile/native test execution | `mobile_testing.py` | Phase 3+ | Playwright mobile web emulation may be earlier |
| n8n / external integration calls | `integration.py` | Phase 2+ | All outbound events disabled by default |
| Cleanup apply / file deletion (foundation-only; dry-run only) | `cleanup.py` | Phase 2+ | `dry_run=True` by default; no deletion without explicit approval |
| Redaction pass (live) | `redaction.py` | Phase 2+ | Schema describes redaction rules only |
| Documentation governance runtime | `documentation.py` | Phase 2+ | `docs_audit.py` is the current lightweight implementation |
| State integration with schemas | `core/state.py` TODO | Phase 2 | QAFactoryState wiring deferred |
| QA Strategy (full execution) — Phase 4A+ | `qa_strategy.py` | Phase 4A+ | Phase 2C builds planning strategy; Phase 3A generates scaffold; execution is Phase 4A+ |
| Framework Scaffold (execution) | `framework_scaffold.py` | Phase 3B+ | Phase 3A generates the scaffold files; TypeScript compilation and test execution require Phase 3B+ approval |

## How to use this manifest

1. **Before starting a phase:** review the Status column. Update stale/needs_review entries first.
2. **After completing a phase:** update the Status column to reflect new state.
3. **When adding a new doc:** add a row here. Set status to `current` only if content is accurate now.
4. **When a doc becomes stale:** change its status to `needs_review` or `stale` and add a note.
5. **When a doc is superseded:** move to the legacy section, set status to `deprecated`.
